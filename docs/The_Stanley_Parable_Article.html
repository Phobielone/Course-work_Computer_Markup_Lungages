                        Computer games are a recent invention. They have not yet managed to accumulate traditions, canons and dogmas, create industrial standards, define academic criteria, outline genres, styles, approaches, acquire a crowd of highbrow explainers of meanings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The gaming industry is a cripple compared to art, enriched by centuries of accumulated experience: with cinematography, rooted in the ancient theater, with literature and painting, which have always been with humanity. Game texts are written by day laborers, they lack depth, rapture, passion. The awkward staging of the cutscenes makes you wince from the amateurish composition of the frame and the flooded light. Game journalists are wicked squalor next to eminent literary critics and film academics. And even the Steam reviewers for the most part are intellectual undersized compared to the reviewers of Kinopoisk and Livelib: chaotic impressions, confused metaphors, peeped conclusions. Sheer shame for the entire review kingdom!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But for a long time now I've been playing more than, for example, watching movies. If you think about the reasons, the answer comes quickly: games are damn interactive!
                    </p>

                        Games not only show and tell, but create spaces of sensations that can be rotated and moved, twisted, shaken, shredded to pieces. Any game is a set of voids for manipulation; not an escalator, but a staircase, or even an Escher labyrinth; it allows you to choose the tempo cadences yourself, does not fix the events with a frozen sequence of frames, does not impose a rhythm, does not string the dried fruits of creation on a thread of perception. Even in the most linear game, free will is woven, even in the narrowest gut you are free to choose paths, trajectories, methods, angles, speeds - you are inside, not outside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You sink into the depths, you become an actor, a performer, an active participant. You listen to yourself, conduct an internal dialogue, supplementing the gameplay inside with spoken and thought out inside. And also competitive conditions that turn the viewer into a player, into a gladiator, into a hero. This magical effect enhances any feelings, paints any cliches. The simplest stories, the most conventional scenery, are perceived deeper, seen more vividly, heard more piercingly, precisely because of the sensations of immersion, involvement, involvement, reconquest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, games are based not on words, sounds or images, but on Spaces that contain everything at once. They take as an intermediary the player's free will, his movements, actions, thoughts: everything that happened and thought out inside, in depth - among locations and characters. This makes the computer game not an art of saying, but an art of harmonious arrangement. Therefore, writing, composing or staging skills are not at all important in development, only the consistency of everything is important: light, text, music, figures, scripts, colors - the ability to correlate them in such a cunning way that the player's movements form an act of creativity - and form rhythms, structures , influence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Game designers are likened to sadistic architects, John Kramer from Saw, obstacle course designers - they manipulate the activities of test subjects, arrange tools for directing the gamer's will to where the strongest effect is born, contrive in setting traps-triggers: enticing views, plot motivations, progression chains, call sequences. The better the manipulation is, the higher the game is rated in the gaming community.

                        The Stanley Parable is one of the first games to take a sober look at this schizophrenia. This is a witty satire that makes fun of the illusory nature of gaming, the hallucination of immersion, the falsity of elections, the cunning cages that imprison free will in the lattices of game structures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She takes the laws according to which the Spaces exist and walks along them with pleasure, as if offering to reject conventions, step over the edge, be bolder, be wittier. She laughs at the straightforwardness of developers not with a clumsy, frontal method, but penetrates into the very cornerstone. Choice. Narrative. Leveldesign. These hackneyed notions, hyperbole exaggerated by a magnifying glass, become helpless idols and go to the landfill.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The methods are simple: "The Parable of Stanley" implicitly invites you to break the rules and introduces dissonance between the environment and the narrative; you throw a naughty party and the comedian Narrator makes a funny comment about it. A guide and educator, he is armed with the entire arsenal of a trickster mentor: feigned indignation at your dementia, malicious instructions, lengthy philosophical digressions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Poor Stanley is no good here. This is never a story about the spiritual rebirth of an office clerk. He's just a button-pressing machine, and he's also you. It's you who's drawn into this artfully acted comedy. Funny, selfless slave. Everything is subordinated to the art of being comical: Narrator's mocking dictates, your performative hooliganism, the absurd demonstration of open doors, juggling game conventions, the possibility of being obnoxious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Stanley Parable is a landmark experiment, must-have and extraordinary. He is an omen of the coming greatness of games, a harbinger of depth, magic, intelligence coming into the industry. It is good both as a statement, and as a triumph of acting, and as a surreal trip. His four hours contain all the possible stamps of our gaming. Are you talking about a broken fourth wall? Haha, this game originally functions without walls. Majikazam!
