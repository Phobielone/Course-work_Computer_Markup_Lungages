                        The cutscene replay effect is the ability of the gameplay to create a replay experience for the player instead of a game experience, that is, to feel the process of playing not like a game. To do this, the gameplay must be simplified to a state where the player's actions do not require skills, but are still mechanics, and at the same time, these player actions can be perceived as replaying the game's plot directly. That is, they are in the context of the plot action. For example, one-cell stealth from Outlast, when one enemy and one path, is just an easy task, and the beginning of Retro City Rampage, containing driving a car and a shootout as part of the narrative, is just about playing a cut-scene and fully meets the above requirements. The gameplay in it does not cross the line, becoming a gaming experience, that is, there is too little of it to form the game as a process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Retro City Rampage example is difficult to explain, you need to feel it, without personal experience it will be problematic to understand it even remotely. Therefore, we will illustrate the work of this technique using the example of Hitman: Absolution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's look at a couple of such moments in the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first situation is the station. We reproduce the Hitman's escape from the police, we can use the concentration on approaching the police, we can just hide in the crowd, gradually moving towards the train. The plot tension of the situation is created in conjunction with our actions, we reproduce the escape and at the same time it does not feel like a full-fledged gameplay, but it is also not a thoughtless sterile pressing, as in the recently disassembled game “Remember ...”, for example, the mechanic of pushing a car. These are two completely different approaches to using mechanics in a narrative environment. In the first case (the effect of playing a cut-scene), the player receives emotions and perceives his actions as a plot.
                    </p>

                <div class="description">   
                    <p>
                        The second situation is a short scene in the desert. In the last mission, we kidnapped the son of the main villain and in this scene we decide his fate. The cut-scene is interrupted and we are given a direct plot to finish it - we can leave and leave the guy in the desert, we can take a weapon from the trunk and shoot the scoundrel. But the main thing here is not the choice, but the fact that we play the game with full control, but without gaming experience, we finish the story. The scene itself screams that this is a cut-scene playback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hitman: Absolution
Bottom line: this effect is a pleasant and positive thing for the player and fully complements the language of video games, proving that simply controlling the character and making simple decisions within the framework of acting out or, more correctly, reproducing the plot, is enough for an interesting experience. Of course, if you do everything right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect of the cut-scene should not be taken as a degradation of the mechanics, it is only a change in its purpose. A good example of how to work with full mechanics within the story, planning and treating the player's actions as a story, not as a gameplay. If we accept that games can do more than just create a game fan, there will be no problems with the perception of this technique. The main thing is not to confuse it with walking simulators, interactive movies and other genres that provide interactive gaming experience exclusively. Sims are all about exploring, searching, whatever, for example, in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, it's about searching for conditional holograms. And interactive cinema is qte, which is generally concentrated gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At present, this application of mechanics in the story is an unconscious random result in development, but I hope that this technique will add to your vocabulary of the game language, and soon there will be games that use it consciously.
