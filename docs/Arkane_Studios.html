                        The level designer of both parts of Dishonored and the designer of the Deathloop campaign, Dana Nightingale, told GamesIndustry.biz what components determine the user's agency - his ability to exercise free will in the game world. We have chosen the main point from the text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Nightingale, for player agency to manifest itself, the user must understand exactly what he wants to do and how to achieve it. That is why developers should clearly explain to the players three things:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        what is their purpose;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        what difficulties stand in their way;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        what tools do they have to overcome the obstacle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user must understand why he performs actions in the game, what is the point of it, what reward he will receive and what value it has.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important component of agency is the ability to independently choose the route of passage. Of course, it is not necessary to make games with a completely open world - it is enough to make it so that users can explore locations in different ways and move around them.
                    </p>

                        When creating locations in Arkane, two approaches are used. The first one is similar to inventing a puzzle: the developers draw a flowchart that shows how different parts of the location are connected to each other. For example, in Dishonored: Death of the Outsider, the bank has several entrances that are located on different floors. And each entrance is a small task that needs to be solved in order to go further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second approach to creating locations is more like traditional building design. For example, when the team came up with Alexis Dorsey's mansion in Deathloop, they were aiming for believabilityâ€”that the place really looked like it belonged to a rich bastard. Once the building was complete, the developers were able to naturally add a variety of entry points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do not oversaturate the environment with content - the player can quickly get fed up and stop paying attention to it. If there is too much content, then it will simply lose value for the user. In addition, the player should be able to take a breath in empty, uncomplicated spaces where nothing happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you always and everywhere find something, things lose their value. In a game where there is a chest behind every waterfall, you will be disappointed if you find a waterfall with nothing behind it. If the chest is only in one out of ten cases, then each such episode will seem like something special.

                        Players want to feel like they make their own decisions. Developers may suggest that players kill enemies in a certain way or choose the best path to a certain place, but if this is done too explicitly, it will deprive players of free will and a sense of power. You can also increase the player's agentivity by allowing him to experiment with his abilities, but not specifying where to use them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user can receive information in different ways to understand his goal. For example, through storytelling, popup, or even level design (as in Mirror's Edge).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ability to choose your playstyle is another way to give the player free will within the game. In Arkane games, there are traditionally two ways to go through locations - openly or covertly. This binary approach may seem to limit the player's agency, but it still allows the user to tailor the gameplay to the situation.
                    </p>
                </div> 
                <div class="news-pic">

                        Arkane understands that adding different styles of passage is a rather difficult task, therefore they strive to make sure that system mechanics are always at the heart of the gameplay. This approach allows you to take into account different ways of passing in advance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, if you add the ability to choose your own style of play, then this will make user behavior unpredictable. That's why in games with emergent mechanics, it's especially important to test how different systems work together. For example, during testing of Dishonored, the developers noticed that playtesters were trying to teleport to the rooftops to cut off part of the level - after that, the team changed the shape of the rooftops so that players could not use this loophole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also impossible for the rules of the game to which the user is accustomed to suddenly change. If he can freely pass everywhere, then you should not suddenly put up an invisible wall. This greatly limits the user's free will and makes it difficult to understand the rules. If the developers add some kind of restriction, then it should be explained to the player.
