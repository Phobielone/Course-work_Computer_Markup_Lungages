                    <p>  
                        The author of the Game Maker's Toolkit YouTube channel, Mark Brown, has released a video about the features of implicit decision making in games. Unlike the explicit type, the implicit type allows the user to make a choice without interrupting the gameplay - with the help of tools that he constantly uses in the passage. We chose the main thing from the video.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brown identifies two types of decision making:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        explicit;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        implicit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of an explicit type, the user finds himself in a situation where the game clearly shows what options are available, and forces him to choose one of them. For example, in BioShock, you can take resources from the Little Sister or save her, but at the same time lose the momentary reward. This choice is designed quite simply: two action buttons appear before the player, and there are no other options to solve this situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An explicit type of decision-making can be implemented in another way: through a radial menu, a list with options for actions, and so on. The main thing is that the player understands exactly what he has to make a decision, and how many options he has.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a player encounters an implicit decision type, they may not even know they are being given a choice. For example, in Spec Ops: The Line, there is a situation in which the player must decide which of two NPCs to keep alive. At the same time, there is no selection menu or hints: the player uses the same tool as in normal gameplay - shooting.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="news-pic">

                <div class="description">   
                    <p>
                        Even though the player is given a choice, it is only driven by the narrative. In fact, the developers have added hidden ways to solve this situation: the player can refuse to open fire at all; shoot the ropes on which the characters are suspended; or kill the snipers who enforce the rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another similar example is in Far Cry 4: at the very beginning of the game, the antagonist asks the protagonist to simply wait a few minutes until he returns. If you obey, then the hero will do exactly what he will go to throughout the passage. These hidden solutions make the player feel smarter and make the game world more believable.
                    </p>

                        One of the problems with explicit decision making is that, from a gameplay standpoint, the choice process is always the same: for example, to save Little Sister in BioShock, the player must simply press a button, and to kill, the player must also press a button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The implicit decision-making method allows for variety. For example, in Undertale it is not necessary to kill opponents - you can negotiate with them peacefully, but this is much more difficult than killing. Therefore, the player must decide for himself what he wants - to become a killer, but at the same time not experience special difficulties in passing, or to become a pacifist, but suffer from high difficulty.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When the player makes an explicit decision, this often allows them to instantly influence the development of the story. And with the help of an implicit type, you can quietly collect information about how the user behaves throughout the game, and then show him the result of his actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A good example of this approach is the chaos system in Dishonored: the more the player kills opponents, the worse the situation on the streets of the city becomes - more rats and sick citizens appear. This approach allows you to personalize the passage and show that the game takes into account even small user actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the player makes a choice, but the consequences are minimal, then this can upset him. If the choice was imperceptible, then even the smallest consequence can make a good impression on the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The implicit decision-making method also has disadvantages. An implicit type is quite difficult to implement - developers must immediately think through all the options that a player can think of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, the user may not even be aware of the existence of several ways to solve the problem, so he must be taught from the very beginning that such forks occur throughout the passage. For example, on Dishonored playtests, some people complained that it turned out to be too linear. They didn’t see that their actions had an effect on something and that in some situations you can do things differently – the forks fit so seamlessly into the game’s design.
