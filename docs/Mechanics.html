                    <p>  
                        If you come up with the idea of a new mechanic, then before proceeding with the implementation, ask yourself the question “why hasn't it been implemented yet?”. Perhaps in the course of a dialogue with yourself with yourself you will find the answer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A simple example: why is there still no first-person shooter game in which you can only move backwards? If this is a shooter, then there must be some obstacles and shelters in it, but how can they be tracked if the character does not see what is behind him? This does not mean that this mechanic is bad, most likely the developers have not yet come up with a good way to implement it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Criteria for the quality of game mechanics
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clarity
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first thing that is important to pay attention to when developing a game is how simple and clear the rules are, whether the mechanics are easy to learn and whether the mechanics are perceived visually from the screenshot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an example, you can see a screenshot from the game Far Cry. The screenshot creates a complete picture of what is happening in the game: we see that this is a first-person shooter, we have allies, we have vehicles, we have dog companions, a variety of weapons, etc. Accordingly, according to this picture, you can already understand what to expect.

                        Interesting solutions
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next criterion is difficult to determine - is it an interesting mechanic. To understand how interesting the mechanic will be, you can study how it meets the expectations of the player. For example, if the player is expecting a shooter, then which one? Take the game Bioshock - it's a first-person shooter, but with the addition of a new feature in the form of plasmids. Thus, we get not just a shooter, but a shooter with an element of magic. From such a decision, we can expect that it will expand the player's capabilities, add new combinations. The process from the mechanics should involve the player and evoke vivid emotions in him, which encourages the player to repeat the actions again and again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All this allows the player to enter the flow state, during which the player is absorbed in the process of passing and stay in it for a long time. A good example of flow immersion is Uncharted. The dynamics of the game change very quickly: first the player runs through the jungle, then the shootout begins, then the puzzle is solved, after a few minutes the chase in a jeep, another shootout, etc. All this keeps the flow state and keeps the player and gives the impression that all these mechanics are very relevant and interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another striking example is the once popular Motorstorm race. This game has a huge variety of vehicles that the player chooses for a particular track. The player does not just ride some motorcycle, he must think about what kind of transport he will need to, for example, drive on a dirt or swamp track. It would be inappropriate to drive a truck along the beach, for this it is better to choose a buggy or vice versa, if we have asphalt, then choose a racing motorcycle.

                        Mechanics must be memorable
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this case, it does not mean that the mechanics are easy to remember in order to apply them during the game, but that the mechanics should evoke emotions that the human brain remembers. It is positive emotions that stimulate the player to return to the game again and again. In addition, it allows players to share positive experiences, which also motivates them to play. In addition to the fact that the mechanics should be memorable, they should not get bored quickly. If the mechanic quickly gets bored with the player, then most likely he will quickly get fed up with positive emotions and stop playing it. To prevent this from happening, one solution is to be able to combine or expand the mechanics. When one mechanic can transform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To understand what is at stake, here is the approach that was used in the game Alto's Adventure. When people hear about sports, they imagine something fast, dynamic, like the games in the Tony Hawk series. But Alto's Adventure gave a new vision to the gameplay in the direction of a calm meditative game. What creates a unique effect is that games with extreme sports can be not only dynamic.

                        Scalability
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many novice developers and game designers do not even think about scalability at the beginning of their development. Scalability determines how the mechanic will develop and how the player will further use its depth. The mechanics can be expanded, improved, supplemented. This allows you to dilute the user's gaming experience and make the game more interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most scalable mechanic to date is Match-3. Using the example of the game Homescapes, there are already several ways of scaling on one playing field: the need to free apples, remove interfering boxes that have several levels of stickiness, and also fill the field with grass.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scalability affects progression: at the beginning of the game, the mechanics are simple, the depth is gradually added, the mechanics scale and the interaction of all these criteria ultimately indicates how the mechanics work for the player, their retention and immersion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's look at three more examples of scalability methods using the games Portal, Talos principle and Witness as examples. The game Portal has fairly simple mechanics, and all scalability rests on the level design. In the second part of the game, scalability is expanded by adding a companion and a narrative. The Talos principle also scales with the help of level design, but as you progress through the game, you can analyze that it is less scalable than Portal. In the third Witness game, the mechanics are related to the snake and the connection of elements. Scalability in this project is due to the environment.
