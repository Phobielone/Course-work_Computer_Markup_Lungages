                        The creator of the indie game Svarog's Dream, alias Lynxbird, posted a list of tips for solo developers on Reddit. They mainly relate to organizational issues that help simplify the workflow. We chose the main thing from the text.

                        A Short Hike. All games mentioned in this text are made by solo developers.Try to spend your mornings developing rather than checking social media or news. This is especially important if you also have a main job. If your work day starts at 8 am, get up at 6 am and dedicate at least an hour to development - this is exactly the time of day when you have a clear head.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do at least something related to the project every day. If you take a break for a few days or weeks, there is a good chance that you will get out of the flow and end up just abandoning development. In this case, it is worth alternating classes. For example, if you are tired of programming, take up art. Breaks can be taken too, but even during those moments, you can look for ideas for your project in TV shows, books, other games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Create a base document describing what you want to do. This will help you realize the idea and will be a reminder of what your ultimate goal is. It will also make it easier for you to explain to other developers what your game is about. Lynxbird has created a template to help describe the idea. If you are having difficulty filling in some items, then this probably means that you still need to think about the concept.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use assets from stores (at least for a prototype). Even large studios use third-party assets when they need to do some not very important things: for example, nature or other elements of the environment. Solo developers don't have to spend five working days creating a ground texture when it can be borrowed for free from some library. Save time where you can.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Use a version control system. You can use standard Git - it's free and has unlimited storage space. If your project takes up more than a few gigabytes, then you should enable Git Large File Storage. This will allow you to experiment with your game without problems, and in case of an error, you can easily return to the previous version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leave comments. You can do this in a special service, for example, Jira, Azure Devops Backlog, or simply write it down on paper. Fix new ideas there, mark what you did last time, so that it would be easier to figure it out later. If you encounter a bug and don't want to fix it now, describe it and continue with the current task.
                    </p>

                        When prototyping, don't overcomplicate your game. Get the core features working, but keep the simplest solutions. After that, you can redo everything to improve the game. Don't spend a month building a system that will later turn out to be superfluous and you just throw it away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Get feedback as soon as possible. Solo developers can easily become subjective and spend a lot of time on a really bad idea. You can present your game on social media and see how users respond. This will give you at least some understanding of whether you are going in the right direction or not. Show the game to your friends or family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But remember that in this case, the number of reviews is important. If one person does not like your combat system, then this does not mean anything. If 10 people out of 20 say that the combat system is really bad, then you might need to redo it.

                        Engage in promotion at the same time as development. Before the release, you have time to gather a loyal audience and show the game to as many people as possible. Try to grab attention by posting a gif of a cute creature from your game, for example. Use Imgur, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and more. Most often, you don't have enough money for full-fledged marketing, so you have to get creative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't chase the latest technology. Is there a new version of the engine? Is there a new version of the IDE, new 3D tools, a new language library, a new rendering pipeline available? Don't rush to switch to them. Estimate the resources that you will have to invest in order to understand the new tool. If the benefits outweigh the costs, then it's worth it. If not, then don't waste your time on this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't trust everything you read. People can make mistakes, some solutions and advice may not suit you specifically. Be critical of everything.
