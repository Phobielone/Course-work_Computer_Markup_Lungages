                        And today we are nostalgic for a pleasant and atmospheric visually, and tense in terms of gameplay game from my childhood. Meet Ballance
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ballance is a 3D puzzle video game developed by Cyparade and published by Atari in 2004. The goal of the game is to roll the ball to the end of each level, solving spatial puzzles along the way without dropping the ball into the abyss. The main feature of the gameplay is the ability to change the material from which the ball is made. By default, it is made of wood, but in special transformers, you can change the material to stone or paper. The game has 12 levels, which, of course, become more difficult with each subsequent one. There is also a secret (bonus) level 13, which is noticeably different from the rest and on which a lot of people suffered trying to pass it. It's pretty complex. But when level 13 is completed, you will see a cool cut-scene of the kidnapping of the ball by an alien plate.

                        This game was and is still being played by speedruns for speed or for who will score more points in each level. She also endured a lot of "modders" who made mods and created their own unique levels.

                        Ballex came out in 2019. This project was done by the indie team MushREB Games Studio, who apparently loved Ballance(2004) and made a fan game similar to the original. They are certainly great, but I believe that the original cannot be surpassed, so I really did not like it, although technically it is understandably better, since it was made 3 years ago. In my opinion, it would be better not to make a Ballance clone, but to write several dozen mods to create your own levels, where you could try yourself as a creator and create what you like.
